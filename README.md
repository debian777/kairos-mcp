AI Knowledge Memory System for AI Agent Consciousness Infrastructure

KAIROS is an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that provides persistent knowledge memory for AI agents, enabling them to store, retrieve, and reason over information across sessions.

## Build, Deploy, and Test

All build, deploy, and test operations are available as npm scripts.

> **Warning:** Always deploy before testing. Tests run against running dev/qa
> servers, so you must deploy your changes first using `npm run dev:deploy` (or
> `npm run qa:deploy`) before running tests.

### Build

```bash
# Build TypeScript to JavaScript (outputs to dist/)
npm run build

# Build for development environment (includes linting)
npm run dev:build

# Build for QA environment (includes linting)
npm run qa:build
```

### Deploy

```bash
# Deploy to development environment (build + restart)
npm run dev:deploy

# Deploy to QA environment (build + start)
npm run qa:deploy
```

### Test

> **Warning:** Deploy before testing. Tests require the server to be running
> with your latest changes.

```bash
# Standard workflow: Deploy first, then test
npm run dev:deploy && npm run dev:test
npm run qa:deploy && npm run qa:test

# Individual test commands (only use if server is already deployed)
npm run dev:test
npm run qa:test
```

**Why deploy first?** Tests connect to the running MCP server. If you've made code changes, you must deploy them (`npm run dev:deploy`) so the server runs your updated code before tests execute.

### Development Environment Management

```bash
# Start development server
npm run dev:start

# Stop development server
npm run dev:stop

# Restart development server
npm run dev:restart

# View development logs
npm run dev:logs

# Check development server status
npm run dev:status

# Access Redis CLI (development)
npm run dev:redis-cli

# Access Qdrant via curl (development)
npm run dev:qdrant-curl
```

### QA Environment Management

```bash
# Start QA server
npm run qa:start

# Stop QA server
npm run qa:stop

# Restart QA server
npm run qa:restart

# View QA logs
npm run qa:logs

# Check QA server status
npm run qa:status

# Access Redis CLI (QA)
npm run qa:redis-cli

# Access Qdrant via curl (QA)
npm run qa:qdrant-curl
```

## CLI Usage

The KAIROS CLI provides a command-line interface for interacting with the KAIROS REST API.

See [docs/CLI.md](docs/CLI.md) for complete CLI documentation, including installation, configuration, and all available commands.

## Snapshot Management

You can back up the Qdrant vector database in two ways:

- Enable automatic Qdrant backups on boot by setting
  `QDRANT_SNAPSHOT_ON_START=true`. Use `QDRANT_SNAPSHOT_DIR` to control where
  snapshot files are written (defaults to `data/qdrant/snapshots`).
- Trigger an on-demand snapshot against the running server with
  `POST /api/snapshot`. The response includes the snapshot file path, byte
  size, and status so you can plug it into backup automation.

### Code Quality

```bash
# Run linter
npm run lint

# Run linter with auto-fix
npm run lint:fix

# Verify clean source (checks for uncommitted changes)
npm run verify:clean
```

### Docker

```bash
# Build Docker image
npm run docker:build
```

## Project Structure

- `src/` - Source TypeScript code
- `src/embed-docs/` - Embedded MCP resources (prompts, tools, templates)
- `dist/` - Compiled JavaScript output
- `tests/` - Test files
- `tests/test-data/` - Test data files
- `scripts/` - Build and utility scripts

## Infrastructure Setup

Start the required infrastructure services (Redis and Qdrant):

```bash
npm run infra:start
```

This starts Redis and Qdrant using Docker Compose with the infrastructure profile.

## Requirements

- Node.js >= 24.0.0
- Docker and Docker Compose (for containerized deployment)
- Qdrant (vector database)
- Redis (caching)

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/debian777/kairos-mcp.git
cd kairos-mcp

# Install dependencies
npm ci

# Copy environment template
cp env.example.txt .env.dev

# Configure your environment variables in .env.dev
# See env.example.txt for all available options

# Start infrastructure
npm run infra:start

# Start development server
npm run dev:start
```
