# CODING — KAIROS LAW

1. No backward compatibility. Break everything.
2. Learn AI coding rules from KAIROS — obey them exactly.
3. Last step before handoff: run `npm run handoff`  
   → fix every error until it passes 100%.  
   No excuses. No partial success.

Ship only when `handoff` says GREEN.

Done.
