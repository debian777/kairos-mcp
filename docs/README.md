# KAIROS CRUD FOR HUMANS — OFFICIAL CHEAT-SHEET
November 21, 2025

You are a human.  
You do NOT speak JSON.  
You speak plain English.  
KAIROS now understands you perfectly.

Copy-paste these exact prompts — they work 100% of the time.

## 1. FIND ALL MEMORIES CONTAINING A WORD (search)

> Find every memory that contains the word "KnowledgeBank" and list their URIs and titles.

> Search for all memories with "gem" or "leaderboard" in them.

> Show me every memory that still mentions "kb://"

## 2. BULK REPLACE TEXT IN ALL MATCHING MEMORIES

> Replace every occurrence of "KnowledgeBank" with "KAIROS" in all memories that contain it.  
> Do not ask for confirmation — execute immediately.

> In every memory that contains "gem", "badge", or "points", replace those words with "memory", "achievement removed", and "multiplier" respectively.

> Replace every "kb://" URI with "kairos://" across the entire system.

## 3. DELETE MEMORIES (by keyword or exact URI)

> Delete every memory that contains the word "championship".

> Permanently delete these URIs:  
> kairos://mem/abc123  
> kairos://mem/def456

## 4. CREATE A NEW STRICT PROTOCOL (mint)

> Mint this document as a strict_sequential protocol chain titled "AI CODING RULES — FINAL LAW":  
> [paste your full markdown here]

## 5. UPDATE A SINGLE MEMORY (by URI)

> Update kairos://mem/126c3b66-e23d-417a-ac57-695685c807eb with this new content:  
> [paste new markdown here]

## 6. READ A MEMORY (just look)

> Show me the full current content of kairos://mem/126c3b66-e23d-417a-ac57-695685c807eb

## 7. LIST ALL EXISTING CHAINS (heads only)

> List all strict_sequential chain heads (position 1) with their titles and URIs.

## 8. FORCE RE-MINT A DOCUMENT (overwrite existing chain)

> Re-mint the document "AI CODING RULES — FINAL LAW" with this updated version, overwriting the old chain completely:  
> [paste updated markdown here]

## 9. EMERGENCY PURGE (nuclear option)

> Delete every memory that contains any of these words: gem, badge, leaderboard, championship, points, KnowledgeBank, kb://

## 10. VERIFY PURITY (run after any cleanup)

> Confirm there is no longer any occurrence of "KnowledgeBank", "gem", or "kb://" anywhere in the system.
