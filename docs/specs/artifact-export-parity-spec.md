# artifact export parity spec

This spec defines the end-to-end artifact train and export parity contract for
the fixture at `tests/test-data/mime-artifact-sample`.

The objective is deterministic byte behavior across transports while preserving
strict transport isolation in tests.

## scope and transports

The parity contract covers three transport families:

- API transport: `/api/train`, `/api/train/raw`, `/api/export`,
  `/api/delete`, and `download_ref` retrieval.
- MCP transport: `train`, `export`, and `delete` via MCP `callTool`.
- CLI transport: `kairos export` and `kairos delete`.

CLI cannot ingest non-markdown artifacts today, so CLI coverage is export-only.
The CLI test pre-trains fixture data via API in `beforeAll`.

### CLI export flags (parity tests)

- `skill_tree`: `kairos export --format skill_tree <adapterUri>` prints JSON to stdout; tests parse that string.
- `skill_zip`: use **`--zip-out <path>`** so the ZIP bytes are written to a file. Without a zip output path, behavior follows normal CLI help (stdout may not carry raw ZIP for all hosts); parity tests require an on-disk file for `SHA256SUMS` extraction.

### Canonical manifest

`tests/test-data/mime-artifact-sample/artifact-contract.json` is the single source
for ordered artifact paths, MIME types, and expected artifact slugs. Integration
tests and `scripts/dev-mime-fixture-train-export.mjs` load it so lists cannot drift.

### Auth for manual dev script

`scripts/dev-mime-fixture-train-export.mjs` reads **`KAIROS_BASE_URL`** (default
`http://localhost:3300`) and optional **`AUTH_BEARER_TOKEN`** for `Authorization:
Bearer …`. Integration tests use the same bearer source as other dev tests via
`getAuthHeaders()` / `.test-auth-env.<env>.json` (see repo test setup docs).

## stage model

The test flow has three stages for API and MCP, and one stage for CLI.

1. Stage 0: train fixture bytes from disk and export bundle `B0`.
2. Stage 1: cleanup stage-0 adapter data, train from `B0`, export `B1`.
3. Stage 2: cleanup stage-1 adapter data, train from `B1`, export `B2`.

CLI runs Stage 0 only because CLI train currently supports markdown files only.

## acceptance criteria by stage

Stage 0 acceptance criteria:

- The seven artifact rows in `<slug>/SHA256SUMS` must match the fixture
  `SHA256SUMS` rows for those same paths.
- The bundle must self-verify (`shasum -a 256 -c` equivalent).
- The `SKILL.md` row is informational only at Stage 0 and is not asserted.

Stage 1 acceptance criteria:

- `B1` `<slug>/SHA256SUMS` body is byte-identical to `B0` body, including file
  order and trailing newline.
- Byte identity includes every row, including `SKILL.md`.
- The bundle self-verifies.

Stage 2 acceptance criteria:

- `B2` `<slug>/SHA256SUMS` body is byte-identical to `B1`.
- The bundle self-verifies.

## per-format assertions

The test assertions are format-specific.

- `skill_tree`: assert paths from `skills[].files[].path`.
- `skill_zip`: assert `skill_bundle_manifest.artifacts` includes all exported
  non-`SKILL.md`, non-`SHA256SUMS` files.

The implementation in `src/tools/export.ts` excludes only `SKILL.md` and
`SHA256SUMS` from the ZIP manifest artifacts array.

## fixture byte contract

Fixture bytes are a train-input contract.

- Files in `tests/test-data/mime-artifact-sample` must be normalized so train
  stores exactly those bytes for artifact payloads.
- Artifact fixture files must not contain trailing whitespace or trailing new
  lines.
- `SHA256SUMS` is generated using bytewise path ordering to match export code.

## cleanup contract

Each test must clean up Stage N adapter data before training Stage N+1.

- API tests use API delete endpoints only.
- MCP tests use MCP delete tool only.
- CLI tests use CLI delete command only.

Shared helpers in `tests/utils/artifact-fixture-cleanup.ts` must treat cleanup as
part of the contract: after a successful HTTP status, **`total_failed` must be
zero** on the delete JSON body (same shape as MCP `delete` and CLI `delete`
stdout). MCP responses are parsed with the same JSON path as other MCP tests.

Cleanup must remove the stage adapter and related artifact memories to avoid
artifact slug collisions in subsequent stages.

## coverage matrix

The fixture and tests cover one markdown adapter plus seven artifact MIME types:

- `SKILL.md` -> `text/markdown`
- `scripts/hello.py` -> `text/x-python`
- `scripts/hello.sh` -> `text/x-shellscript`
- `scripts/hello.cjs` -> `text/javascript`
- `scripts/hello.pl` -> `text/x-perl`
- `conf/app-config.toml` -> `text/x-toml`
- `conf/routes.yaml` -> `text/yaml`
- `notes.txt` -> `text/plain`
