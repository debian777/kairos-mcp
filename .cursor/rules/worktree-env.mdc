description: Sync .env from main worktree when working in this git workspace

# Worktree env setup

This workspace is a **git worktree**. The environment file (`.env`) is not shared across worktrees.

**When to run the script manually:**

- **"Copy env from main" / "sync env"**: run `./scripts/copy-env-from-main.sh` to copy `.env` from the main worktree (e.g. after changing secrets in main).
- Or use the task **"Copy .env from main"** (Terminal → Run Task… → Copy .env from main).

The script resolves the main worktree via `git worktree list` (first line) and copies `.env` from there. Safe to run in the main worktree (no-op).
