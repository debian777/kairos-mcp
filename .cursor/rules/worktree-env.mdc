# Worktree env setup

This workspace is a **git worktree**. Environment files (`.env`, `.env.dev`, `.env.qa`, `.env.prod`) are not shared across worktrees.

**When working in this workspace:**

1. **If `.env` or `.env.qa` (or other `.env*`) are missing** or the user asks to set up env / copy env from main:
   - Run `./scripts/copy-env-from-main.sh` to copy all `.env*` from the main worktree into this directory.
   - Or tell the user to run the task **"Copy .env from main"** (Terminal → Run Task… → Copy .env from main).

2. **If the user says "copy env from main" or "sync env":**
   - Run `./scripts/copy-env-from-main.sh` (or suggest the task).

The script resolves the main worktree via `git worktree list` (first line) and copies every `.env*` file from there into the current workspace root. It is safe to run when already in the main worktree (no-op).
